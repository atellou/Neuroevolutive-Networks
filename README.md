This repository contains some useful functions to run a model based on the Neuroevolutive principle. These functions, for the moment, are based on the NEAT library of python.

* The neuroevo.py file contains a class object to define the fitness function. Additionally, a modified version of the run script gave by NEAT.
* The Visualize and config files are the scripts also given by NEAT to run the code. The Visualize file contains some slight modifications.
* The script utility.py contains some functions designed to run the code and use *run* function in neuroevo.py.
